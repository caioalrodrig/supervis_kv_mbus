# Refinery app with Python üè≠

This project is based on the youtube tutorial, provided by Guilherme M√°rcio. The full riquerements and the refinery server can be found here:[^1].
The server generates periodically sensor data, for simulation purposes.
The application was tested for the Industrial Informatics course, as a requirement for obtaining grades. This app was also tested in a laboratory as a TCP-client for a real PLC.

App main funcionalities:
- TCP Mudbus Communication.
- Kivy language UI.
- Three screens:
    - Main sensors.
    - Database query.
    - Real time plotter.
### Connectivity

The project illustrates very well Python simplicity, creating a high-level and "low code" TCP-modbus service.
